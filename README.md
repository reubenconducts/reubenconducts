- 👋 Hi, I’m @reubenconducts
- 👀 I’m interested in music, math, and helping people
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic data analysis. I'd like to learn to apply topological data analysis to real-world projects (since topology is my field of study!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure yet! Would love to find projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: reuben@stern-reuben.com is the best way! I am also on Instagram @reubassoon and Twitter @reubenconducts.
